# zephyr-nfc08a1
Zephyr app to drive the X-NUCLEO-NFC08A1

It relies on the https://github.com/ptournoux/zephyr-st25r zephyr module which is an adaptation of https://github.com/vouch-opensource/zephyr-nfc08a1 to Zephyr 4.

The instruction below assume that you installed zephyr by following the [getting started](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) procedure of zephyr.

# Add module `zephyr-st25r` to you `west.yml` file

In your workspace, add the following entry to your manifest file west.yml :

```
    - name: zephyr-st25r
      url: https://github.com/ptournoux/zephyr-st25r.git
      revision: main  # Or the specific branch or commit hash you want
      path: modules/lib/zephyr-st25r

```

If you followed the [getting started](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) procedure of zephyr, the manifest file is in `~/zephyrproject/zephyr/west.yml`.

Update west to download the module :

```bash
west update
```


## Add a st,st25r SPI to your device configuration

If you do not use a `nucleo_l073rz` board, you may need to configure your device tree/overlay so that the `st,st25,` module can find the SPI/I2C configuration on your board.

To use, after incorporating the module into your build, add an 
`st,st25r` compatible SPI or I2C configuration to your device tree

```
&spi3 {
    status = "okay";

    cs-gpios = <&gpio1 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

    nfc0: st25r@0 {
        compatible = "st,st25r";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <4000000>;
        irq-gpios = <&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    };
};
```

and configure the device in your `prj.conf` file as desired

```
CONFIG_ST25R=y
CONFIG_ST25R3916B=y
CONFIG_ST25R_TRIGGER_GLOBAL_THREAD=y

CONFIG_RFAL_FEATURE_NFCA=y
CONFIG_RFAL_FEATURE_ISO_DEP=y
CONFIG_RFAL_FEATURE_ISO_DEP_POLL=y
```

After that you can use RFAL to drive the IC

```c
#include "rfal_nfc.h"

void init() {
   ReturnCode err = rfalNfcInitialize();
   /* Use RFAL to poll NFC. */
}
```


## Test using a complete project

You can now download a complete example. E.g. in your workspace `~/zephyrproject/zephyr` run :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ptournoux/zephyr-app-nfc08a1
```

Then run :

```
west build --board=nucleo_l073rz -p always zephyr-app-nfc08a1
```

Connect your `nucleo_l073rz` board to your computer and run ·∫Åest flash`.

Read the logs through picocom : 

```
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
```

The output should look like below : 

```
NFCA Passive ISO-DEP device found. UID: 04616F42146680
 Select NDEF Application: OK Data: 6A82

## Special thanks to ....

Both the module and sample application comes from https://github.com/vouch-opensource/zephyr-nfc08a1 with some minor modifications to make them compatible with Zephyr 4.
